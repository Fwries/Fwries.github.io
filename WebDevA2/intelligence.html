			<h1> Crows are Smart! </h1>
			<p> As a group, crows show remarkable examples of intelligence. Natural history books from the 18th century recount an 
				often-repeated, but unproven anecdote of "counting crows" â€” specifically a crow whose ability to count to five (or four 
				in some versions) is established through a logic trap set by a farmer. Crows and ravens often score very highly on 
				intelligence tests. Certain species top the avian IQ scale. Wild hooded crows in Israel have learned to use bread crumbs 
				for bait-fishing. Crows engage in a kind of mid-air jousting, or air-"chicken" to establish pecking order. They have been 
				found to engage in activities such as sports, tool use, the ability to hide and store food across seasons, episodic-like 
				memory, and the ability to use individual experience in predicting the behavior of proximal conspecifics. 
			</p>
				
			<p> One species, the New Caledonian crow, has also been intensively studied recently because of its ability to manufacture 
				and use tools in the day-to-day search for food. On 5 October 2007, researchers from the University of Oxford presented 
				data acquired by mounting tiny video cameras on the tails of New Caledonian crows. They pluck, smooth, and bend twigs 
				and grass stems to procure a variety of foodstuffs. Crows in Queensland have learned how to eat the toxic cane toad by 
				flipping the cane toad on its back and violently stabbing the throat where the skin is thinner, allowing the crow to 
				access the nontoxic innards; their long beaks ensure that all of the innards can be removed. The western jackdaw and 
				the Eurasian magpie have been found to have a nidopallium about the same relative size as the functionally equivalent 
				neocortex in chimpanzees and humans, and significantly larger than is found in the gibbons. Crows have demonstrated 
				the ability to distinguish individual humans by recognizing facial features. Evidence also suggests they are one of 
				the few nonhuman animals, along with insects like bees or ants, capable of displacement (communication about things 
				that are not immediately present, spatially or temporally). <br> <br>
				
				In Japan, crows have demonstrated the ability to learn how to use public drinking fountains for both water and 
				bathing purposes. In the Gumyoji Park of Yokohama crows have shown the ability to both activate public drinking 
				fountains and adjust the water flow to appropriate levels for either bathing or drinking. In the past there have 
				been plenty of studies conducted on how ravens and corvids in general learn. Some of these studies have concluded 
				that the brains of ravens and crows compare in relative size to great apes. The encephalization quotient (EQ), 
				helps to expose the similarities between a great ape brain and a crow/raven brain. This includes cognitive ability.
				Even though the brain differs significantly between mammals and birds we can see larger forebrains in corvids than 
				other birds (except some parrots), especially in areas associated with social learning, planning, decision making 
				in humans and complex cognition in apes. Along with tool use, ravens can recognize themselves in a mirror. This 
				complex cognition can also be extended to socio-cognitive abilities. Studies have been conducted regarding the 
				development and evolution of social abilities in ravens. These results help to show how ravens prefer to form 
				stable relationships with siblings and close social partners as opposed to strangers. The development in social 
				abilities is essential for raven survival, including identifying whether something poses a threat and how ravens 
				alert others nearby of an incoming threat.
