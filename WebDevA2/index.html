			<p> Corvus is a widely distributed genus of medium-sized to large birds in the family Corvidae. 
				It includes species commonly known as crows, ravens and rooks. Medium-large species are 
				ascribed to the genus, ranging from 34 cm of some small Mexican species to 60â€“70 cm of the 
				large common raven and thick-billed raven, which together with the lyrebird represent the 
				larger passerines. These are birds with a robust and slender appearance, equipped with a 
				small rounded head with a strong conical beak, elongated and pointed, with a slightly curved 
				end towards the bottom: the legs are strong and the tail is short and wedge-shaped. The 
				coloration of the livery is dominated by shades of black, with some species having plumage 
				with metallic iridescence and others that have white or gray areas on the neck or torso: 
				Australian species have light eyes, while generally the irises are dark.
