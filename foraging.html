			<p> Along with other birds, ravens have been known to associate with other animals like coyotes and wolves. 
				These associations are linked to feeding and hunting. Ravens use their calls to notify these animals 
				when an injured prey is near. This interaction is most noticeable in winter where ravens are associated 
				with wolf packs nearly 100% of the time. As a result of this connection, there have been studies 
				conducted on the reaction of prey animals to the call of the raven. In areas where ravens associate with 
				predators, prey animals are more likely to avoid predation by leaving after hearing the call. They are 
				also capable of distinguishing between coyotes and wolves and have shown a preference for wolves. This 
				may be due to the fact that wolves kill larger prey. When hunting, ravens can locate injured animals, 
				like elk, and can call out to wolves to kill them. At times, ravens associate with wolves even when 
				there is no carcass and can even be seen forming relationships with them. This includes playing with 
				cubs by using sticks, picking at their tails, or flying around them. Ravens have been mostly seen among 
				travelling wolf packs rather than resting wolves, possibly due to the increased likelihood of food. They 
				are also known to trust wolves in the pack they follow, when encountering a carcass killed by animals other 
				than wolves they will be more apprehensive to eat from it. This symbiotic relationship between ravens and 
				wolves is shown to be mutualistic, ravens help wolves find prey and when the wolves kill them the ravens 
				can eat too. However, this relationship is not without its faults. Ravens may at times eat more of the prey 
				than the wolf does. This problem has also been linked to wolf pack size, with some researchers suggesting 
				that one of the reasons wolves hunt in larger packs is so that ravens (and other scavengers) get less of 
				the food. Along with contention in wolves, ravens can also bother each other. By feeding off of the same 
				carcass it is possible that some ravens will steal from their conspecifics. This behaviour is related to 
				the ravens' ability to make quick decisions about eating the food then or storing it for later, and to 
				their dominance and fighting ability.
