		<h1>Others!</h1>
		<p>Faries likes to stand out from the crowd by doing unsual things. It is what he enjoys the most. Having fun every second he is doing something stupid and weird.
		From simple stuff like his unsual habit of collecting "Junk" as a form of trophies to the weird adventures he does occasionally like wearing a dinosaur onesie and
		walking around the airport; That was fun. </p>
		
		<p>Faries gets bored easily. He is one of those people who "cant sit still". Faries often thinks about what to do to express his "Creativity" next or what kind of
		adventure he would like to go next; Maybe ordering a cheese burger without the cheese, pickels, sauce and the patty (He did that before, confused all the 
		Mcdonalds staff for a good 20mins)</p>
		
		<p>Faries is a lazy person. He dislikes doing tedious things, althought he would do anything to do something stupid, he would not do something that he thinks is too
		boring and is a waste of time. For an example, going out to buy food or ordering food online when there is no food at home, queuing a queue that has more than 4 people
		linning up eventhough he has not eaten yet. Weird how Faries is skinny. Huh.</p>
