		<h1>Primary School: Beacon</h1>
		<a href="https://beaconpri.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Website</a>
		
		<p> Beacon Primary School was the first new primary school set up as part of the 
		<a href="https://emprovedu.wordpress.com/future-schools/" target="_blank">FutureSchools@Singapore</a> (FS@SG) programme.
		Which was a programme to effectively harness the benefits of technology for engaged learning. From Primary 3 we were
		required to bring our own laptop to school to learn with. Because of this, I was already very tech savvy from a young age
		as I was thought how to use different softwares like Powerpoint and Excel sheet in my presentations at school. <p>
		
		<p> The school had a small program where they teached us how to code with a beginner codding software called 
		"<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>".
		Since we had to produce a small game that will be graded. I learned alot about codding and eventually fell in love with it.
		The idea to create your own game, with crazy and outlandish themes. I then learned further ahead even after that program ended.
		It was also in this school that I found my love of sports as I join the Soccer CCA. Even if we did not gotten that far
		into the tournament, I had fun playing sports with my teammates against other schools. <p>

		<h1>Secondary School: Regent</h1>
		<a href="https://regentsec.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Website</a>
		
		<p> Regent Secondary School has a hands-on-approach on education as their academic curriculum, which is inclusive, 
		collaborative and experiential, Applied Learning Programme (ALP), which focuses on STEM knowledge and skills in the 
		construction of Sea Perch and Outdoor Learning Programme (OLP), which is inter-disciplinary and authentic in learning experience.</p>
		
		<p> I joined another Sports CCA in Regent, after having so much fun with Soccer in Secondary School. But this time, I'm trying a new
		sport I have not heard of, HandBall. Handball is basicly Basketball but scoring is similar to Soccer. I fell in love with this Sport
		and my new teammates. We then consistently placed top 3 in Singapore Secondary School Handball division year after year. I was the
		team goalkeeper, it is a tough possition as in Handball, people shoot the Handball with their hand at hight speed and with more control.
		But, Goalkeeping is fun as I like to play mindgames forcing them to shoot at a favourable position or predict where they are shooting.
		Sadly though Regent Handball consistently placed top 3 and even got first multiple times, the CCA had to close down because the principle
		greed of buying more plants to make the school "Green". The school was then filled with multiple bamboo shoots and new trees. I hate Regent.</p>
